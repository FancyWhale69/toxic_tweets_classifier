1- python 3.x  
2- jupiter notebook  
3- plotly  
4- matplotlib

# Project Motivation
The goal of this notebook is to understand some characteristics of toxic tweets and to build a ML pipeline to classify tweets into toxic or non toxic.  

# File Descriptions  
Toxic_Tweets.ipynb: A notebook with all the analysis and ML model.  
stop_words_english.txt: A file with all the english stop words.  

# How To Interact With Your Project  
Make sure to download everything you need from the installation section.  
Download the notebook then run all the cells.  

# Results Summery  
From tha data visulazation phase it can observed that toxic tweets contains a lot of swear words and usally found in ploitcal hastags. on the other hand non-toxic tweets contains positive words and mostly found in positive hashtags.

ML model achived an accuracy of 94%, while the LSTM network i built achived from 91% to 93% while being slow in the training phase unlike the ML model.
